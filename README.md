# Memology - A visual RAG system for finding your memes on the fly
A simple tool based on Python, Ollama and Langchain that indexes your local meme folder 
and suggests to you memes based on embeddings of descriptions created by llama3.2-vision.
It also renames the images with a short catchy title.

This could be integrated into chat clients like Discord in the future. 
As this is not allowed as of now it remains a standalone python tool.
